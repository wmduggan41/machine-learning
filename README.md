# Machine Learning

`Learning Objectives`

1. Each week consisted of an overview and a task schedule along with specific modules that delved deep into specific concepts. 
2. The course curriculum progressed from basic notions such as k-Nearest Neighbors to more advanced methodologies such as Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Recurrent Neural Networks. 
3. This systematic approach provided students with a well-rounded understanding of machine learning algorithms and techniques.
