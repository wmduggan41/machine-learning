`Climate change project`

The final project for the Advanced Machine Learning course involved working collaboratively on a dataset concerning global climate temperature change. The data, distributed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Institute for Space Studies (NASA-GISS) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations' web data portal, covers the period 1961â€“2021. It provides temperature anomalies for all countries and territories in the world, both monthly and annually.

The primary focus of the project was not just about achieving high accuracy but also about creatively exploring the dataset and asking meaningful questions that have not been addressed previously. The project was done in a group, consisting of myself and my colleagues Alexander Guillen, and Doug Rizio.

We started with a thorough exploration and cleaning of the dataset, dealing with missing values, and preparing the data for analysis. The data contained attributes such as Area Code, Area (Countries and Territories), Months, Element Code, Element (Temperature change, Standard Deviation), Unit (Celsius degrees), and Source (Climate Data).
